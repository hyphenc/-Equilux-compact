## Some Equilux fork
forked from: https://github.com/ddnexus/equilux-theme
I changed some things but forgot what and I'm too lazy to backtrack all that :)

# Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/hyphenc/Equilux-compact
sudo mv Equilux-compact/ /usr/share/themes/
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.user-theme name "Equilux-compact"
```
